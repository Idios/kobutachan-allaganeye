"""Presence-based match detection (scorebar present/absent as the signal).

Phase 1 of the presence-detection engine (spec
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-29-presence-based-detection-engine-design.md).
This module is ADDITIVE and NOT wired into the production detection path;
it exists for the offline validation harness only.  The brightness-based
``detector.detect_match_boundaries`` remains the production detector until
the Phase 3 cutover.
